# Fake-News-Detection
Used dataset from Kaggle and implemented LR, bagging and boosting techniques for modeling.                                  
Used RandomizedCV, GridSearchCV, Bayesian Optimizer, Genetic Algorithm for Hyperparameter tuning.                                                     
The dataset used was taken from kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-news                                
Upon final submission highest performing model was AdaBoost with hyperparameter tuned using GridSearchCV.        
The accuracy achieved on Test data was - 99.478%
