# Fake-News-Detection
The dataset used was taken from kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-news                                
Implemented LR, bagging and boosting techniques for modeling. Furthermore, TPOT Classifier was used as an autoML model.                                                
Used RandomizedCV, GridSearchCV, Bayesian Optimizer, Genetic Algorithm for Hyperparameter tuning.                                                     
Upon final submission highest performing model was AdaBoost with hyperparameter tuned using GridSearchCV.   

The accuracy achieved on Test data was - 99.478%
